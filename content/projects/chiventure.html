    <p>Chiventure is a game engine built to run text-based games specified in an original file format designed for this project. This project was the creation of UChicago’s software development class - a course where 30 students spend 10 weeks
      working
      together to develop on major project.It is intended to be a simulation of what it is like to work on a real software development team.

    <p>
      This game, like many classic text-based games allow the player to navigate and interact with the world of this game via text commands.

    <p>I was on the UI team for this project. We developed the entire UI using the NCurses library which allowed us to have this game run entirely in a linux terminal. I developed a map interface that generates a map from the game file and
      updates to
      show the player where they are in game world. Visual elements like this are not typical of the classic text-based games we were emulating with this project but we felt that this addition added a lot of value to the text-based format.

    <p>This is an image of a near-final iteration of the map. The main component of the map is the grid of boxes representing “rooms” or areas of the game. You can see a small ascii character-based person in the center indicating the player’s
      location
      and in the upper left hand corner, the x, y, and z coordinates of the player’s current location. Some version of the map also include illustrations of connections between rooms.
