    <p>I serve as the Vice President and Treasurer of the The University of Chicago Engineering Society. The Engineering Society is a group of students from a variety of backgrounds and majors who are passionate about Engineering.  We host educational workshops, guest speakers, networking events, community service fundraisers and weekly project nights all designed to help University of Chicago Students and the surrounding communities engage with Engineering in a fun and educational way.

    <p>During our project nights, we design and build things across a wide variety of engineering disciplines. Our past projects have included a robotic arm, an acoustic levitators, a 3D printer and rockets. We are currently working on a robot that assembles lego structures.

        <p>In addition to the fundraising work and engineering projects that I lead as Vice President and Treasurer, I also have led a rebranding of the club's graphic design and advertising. Pictured above is a sample of the style guide I created for the organization's print and digital communications. Additionally, I've designed standing banners for recruitement events (left), flyers, and social media templaes for the club to use going forward. I am currently working on club merchandise and spray-painting stencils. These initiatives have helped us attract dozens of new members and event attendees this year.
