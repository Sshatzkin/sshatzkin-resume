    <h2 class="mb-5">Google Home LED Encoding</h2>
    <p>A partner and I built this project at Uncommon Hacks 2019, UChicago’s annual Hackathon. The hackathon encourages projects that are “uncommon” over projects that may be more practical.
    </p>
    <p>Our project converts audio messages that a user gives a google home to a series of LED light blinks on our LED-to-Alphabet translation board, inspired by a scene from the Netflix Show, Stranger Things.
    </p>
    <p>I first developed a google home application in which the google assistant prompts the user to say a message. The google assistant app then uploads this message to a google firebase server. The lights on the board are operated by an arduino
      UNO running
      character-to-LED blink translation functions. I used a python script to pull updated messages off of the firebase server and send them to the UNO via serial port messages.
