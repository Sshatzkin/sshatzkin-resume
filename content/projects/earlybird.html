    <p>In the winter of my second year at UChicago, I enrolled in Entrepeneurship in Technology, a Master's level course that accepts a handful of undergraduates each year.

      In this class, we worked in teams to develop a startup from problem to product in 10 weeks.

    <h4>
      Problem:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Back in the pre-COVID world, people used to work in public spaces like libraries and coffee shops. However, this comes with the risk of arriving at a busy venue without available seating or sitting down only to find out that there are no outlets to charge your laptop or terrible internet speeds. After going through the hastle of finding a workspace that satisfies their needs, most people fall into a routine of frequenting the same places, often at the same times because it is difficult to break routine and find new workspaces. Current solutions such as Yelp and Google provide statistics for businesses, but those applications prioritize proximity in their search algorithm, not workspace-relevant features like noise level, public internet access, or how comfortable the seating is.

      Product:

    <p>
      Early Bird is a community-driven web-application that helps students find ideal study spaces and remote workers identify new public spaces to work from. Aggregating user-reported data about seating availability, wifi status, and other relevant needs and preferences, Early Bird can provide users with personalized recommendations for the best workspaces that suit their needs. If your favorite spot is near capacity, weâ€™ll help you find the next best thing by tailoring our search to your preferences.
