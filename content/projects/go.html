    <p>Go is an ancient Chinese two-player game. I recreated the game go with the programming language Typed Racket for a course I was enrolled in.
    </p>
    <p>The game is fully playable by two players. Notice the UI details - a holographic circle under the cursor indicating a potential placement, a star indicating the last placed piece, a square indicating where a piece was captured last turn,
      and a series
      of timers showing how much time each player has spent planning their moves.
    </p>
    <p>The most challenging component of building this game was constructing the mechanic that removes pieces from the board. In go, a string of adjacent pieces is captured when the string is entirely surrounded by the opponentâ€™s pieces or edges
      of the board. Checking
      for this case is actually a graph theory problem that required a graph traversal algorithm to resolve.
