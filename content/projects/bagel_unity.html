    <p>Bagel is a multiplayer word-scramble game that I constructed in Unity. Inspired by a Hasbro game of an admittedly similar name that I play quite frequently, I decided to develop a digital version of the game.
    </p>
    <p>Digitizing the board allowed my to achieve two personal goals. It allows me to play a fair game of "bagel" with anyone in any location and it allows me to find all possible words in the bagel board.
    </p>
    <p>The text box on the left side of the board is used for seeding the random number generator that plays a pivotal role in board generation. Two players can use the same seed to ensure they generate identical boards. This allows long-distance
      play and non-simultaneous play.
    </p>
    <p> In order to find every possible word in the board, an graph-traversing algorithm is running the background while the player searches the board. This algorithm iterates over the board and checks possible words against a specialized data
      structure called a Trie which contains every word in the english language. This system is extremely efficient and allows the algorithm to return all possible words within less than a second, much faster than any human player could even scan
      the board.
