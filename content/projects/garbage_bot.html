    <h3 class="mb-3">Research Overview</h3>
    <p>
      "Be Nice to Garbage Bot" is a human-robot interaction (HRI) research study
      conducted by myself, Lane Painter, and Yutao Cao that explored how simple
      design modifications affect human willingness to assist robots in public
      settings. The experiment investigated whether adding googly eyes to a
      non-humanoid robot would increase the likelihood of people helping it with
      a simple task.

    <p>
      The study was conducted at the University of Chicago's John Crerar Library
      using a Hello Robot Stretch - a utilitarian, non-anthropomorphic robot
      designed for assistive tasks. We implemented a 2x2 experimental design
      testing two key factors: the presence or absence of googly eyes on the
      robot, and whether the robot approached individuals or small groups for
      assistance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The robot was programmed to attempt picking up bottles near a trash can,
      deliberately failing in a realistic manner before requesting help from
      passersby with the phrase "Could you please assist me in picking up this
      piece of garbage?" The experiment used a Wizard-of-Oz approach, with team
      members remotely controlling the robot's movements and speech through an
      Xbox controller and digital soundboard.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-3">Key Findings</h3>
    <p>
      Our research revealed significant differences in human behavior based on
      the robot's appearance. Participants interacting with the eye-equipped
      robot showed substantially higher intervention rates compared to the
      no-eyes condition. While most people paused to assess the situation
      regardless of the robot's appearance, those encountering the robot without
      eyes frequently expressed confusion about the source of the voice or the
      robot's intentions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interestingly, we observed that all small groups approached by the robot
      chose to intervene and assist, likely due to group members discussing the
      situation and providing mutual reassurance about how to help. This finding
      suggests that group dynamics can overcome individual hesitation in
      human-robot interactions.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-3">Research Impact</h3>
    <p>
      This study contributes valuable insights to the growing field of
      human-robot interaction, particularly as service robots become more
      prevalent in public spaces like hospitals, restaurants, and hotels. The
      research demonstrates that simple, low-cost design modifications - such as
      adding eyes - can significantly improve a robot's ability to receive
      assistance from humans when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The findings have practical implications for robotics designers,
      suggesting that even non-anthropomorphic robots benefit from minimal
      anthropomorphic features that help humans understand how to interact with
      them. As autonomous robots increasingly operate in public environments,
      understanding these interaction dynamics becomes crucial for their
      successful deployment and acceptance.
