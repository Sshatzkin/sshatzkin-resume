      At UChicago, we regularly recieve security alerts about local safety incidents but the emails that the school provides are sparse with details and give only a street address, making it a little bit difficult to understand where and when these incidents are happening. Students deciding how to walk home from class at night or students looking for appartments off-campus would benefit from having access to this information in a user-friendly and intuitive format.

      At Uncommon Hacks 2020, I decided to build a prototype of a security application using React that plots real data from the public UCPD incident archive onto a Google Maps API-driven map. Users can filter Map data by incident type, time, location to find information relevant to their needs.
